// Package main contains standalone example programs that demonstrate how to use
// the goisl (Go Input Sanitization Library) package.
//
// These CLI-style examples show how to sanitize and validate various types of
// input, such as emails, URLs, file names, and more â€” including custom hook
// implementations for domain-specific filtering (e.g., blocking URL shorteners,
// transliterating German characters, or censoring profanity).
//
// Each example can be run independently using `go run`, and is designed to be
// educational, copy-paste friendly, and easy to extend for real-world usage.
//
// See README.md in this directory for a list of available examples.
